Quick and easy to use URL shortener

# How-To
## Starting the backend:
### If you're using Docker: 
Simply run `docker-compose up --build`

### If you're using your own IDE + MySQL:
- Make sure MySQL is running on Port 3306
- Import `shorty-server` to your IDE as a Maven Project
- Run `ShortyServerApplication.java`

## Starting the frontend
- CD into `shorty-client`
- run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `npm run start` to startup the frontend on port 4200


## Once both backend and frontend are running
- Just navigate to `localhost:4200` or `localhost:4200/home`
